# Documentation for the chatbot

## Business Understanding
* The chatbot is designed to help users to easily deal with their mental health issues especially 
depression and anxiety and the country is Kenya.
* The chatbot however can be used by anyone in the world and it is not meant to subtitute a professional
therapist. The chatbot is meant to be used as a tool to help users to deal with their mental health issues
and to help them to get professional help.  It is also meant to help users to get information about mental
health issues and to help them identify if they have a mental health issue and the nearest mental health
facility to them.

## Data Understanding
* The data used for this project is from the [Kaggle Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)
* The data was collected from 2014 to 2016 and it contains 1259 rows and 27 columns.
* The data contains information about the mental health of tech workers in the USA originally but for the sake of this project,the 

## Data Preparation
* The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. The data was cleaned by removing the columns that were
not needed for the analysis and the rows that had missing values. The data was also prepared for analysis
by creating new columns that were needed for the analysis ie feature engineering. The data was also
prepared for analysis by encoding the categorical variables. The data was also prepared for analysis by
scaling the numerical variables.

## Modelling
* The data was split into train and test sets but since it is a chatbot, the data was not split into train
and test sets. The data was split into train and test sets to test the performance of the model. The data
was split into train and test sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection
library. The data was split into train and test sets with a test size of 0.2 and a random state of 42.
* The data was then trained using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The data was trained using the
a deep learning neural network algorithm from the Tensorflow library.

## Evaluation
* The model was evaluated using the accuracy score and loss. The model was evaluated using the accuracy score
from the sklearn.metrics library. The model was evaluated using the accuracy score with a random state
of 42. The loss was also evaluated using the loss function where closer to 0 is better.


## Deployment
* The chatbot was deployed using the Flask framework from the flask library. The chatbot was deployed using the Flask framework among other libraries like
pickle, numpy, pandas, sklearn, nltk, re, json, random, string, warnings, os, sys, time, datetime,
threading, flask, flask_cors, flask_restful, flask_restful_swagger_2, flask_sqlalchemy etc. For scalability, the project will be deployed on Streamlit cloud or better 
still on AWS or Azure.

## Future Work
* The chatbot can be improved by adding more features to it such as a feature that will help users to 
get professional help. There can also be a feature that will help users to get information about mental
health issues and to help them identify if they have a mental health issue and the nearest mental health
facility to them.

## Acknowledgements
* I would like to thank the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey team for providing the data for this project.
* I would also like to thank the Kaggle community for providing the data for this project.
