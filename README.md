# Mental Health Chatbot
* `End goal`: develop a chatbot using machine learning that can provide mental health support to people in Kenya. The chatbot should be able to detect and analyze the user's messages and provide appropriate responses and resources, including information on mental health disorders, coping mechanisms, and professional help. Use a dataset of mental health conversations collected from various sources, including online forums, support groups, and counseling sessions. The dataset should be preprocessed to remove any identifying information and annotated with relevant labels, such as emotions and mental health disorders. They can also use existing resources, such as the Kenya Ministry of Health's Mental Health Policy and the World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Programme, to inform their chatbot's responses and resources.
